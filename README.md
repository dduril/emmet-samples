# Emmet Demos

Boostrap site showcasing samples of using Emmet to quickly generate HTML templates and snippets.

Included are what I've found to be some of the more common snippets that I'm always cranking out and I've 
also included some that are specific to Bootstrap snippets and constructs.

Built using npm for installing and managing Bootstrap, jQuery and Underscore.js libraries and hand-coded using the 
Brackets open-source code editor.
