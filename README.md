# Emmet Demos

Boostrap site showcasing samples of using Emmet to quickly generate HTML templates and snippets.

Included are what I've found to be some of the more common snippets that I'm always cranking and I've 
also included some specific to Bootstrap.

Built using npm to pull down the Bootstrap, jQuery and Underscore.js libraries and hand-coded using the 
Brackets open-source code editor.
